## Overview

### About Project

This project is a product feedback app that like the name suggests it is used to let user's of a product or service comment or suggest improvement on the aforementioned product or service. It even has a board to let the users know were the status of there suggested improvement is in or if the company has choosen to discard the suggested improvements. It has responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile screens. I used React and ModularCSS with a desktop first workflow for the front-end and node.js and Atlas/MongoDB database for the back-end. It is fully online on a Heroku server.
